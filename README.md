  In short, Virtual Machines (VMs) are heavyweight and Containers are lightweight. Virtualization requires a Host Operating System (HOS) and a hypervisor which runs and manages one or more VMs. Additionally, each application must have a seperate Guest Operating System that can be major hurdles for Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) since our major goal is to find the bug as early as possible. On the other hand, containerization mandates only HOS and supporting files run time such as Docker. In each supporting files run time, there would be multiple applications running depends on the need of the infrastructure.
